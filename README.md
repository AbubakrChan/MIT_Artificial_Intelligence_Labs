# MIT_Artificial_Intelligence_Labs

This is my Python implementation of all the labs of the subject 6.034 Artificial Intelligence at MIT during Fall Semester 2017.

To run the code just go the directory of the lab (using cd) and write: python3 tester.py

Please let me know any suggestion or comment you could have about the code.
